## Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

## Description
This is my second project in Udacity course: Programming for Data Science with Python
**Overview**
I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

**What Software Do I Need?**
To complete this project, the following software was used:
* Python 3, NumPy, and pandas.
* Eclipse with python plugin Pydev.
* A terminal application (Git Bash on Windows).

**The Datasets**
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core **six (6)** columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

## Files used
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
